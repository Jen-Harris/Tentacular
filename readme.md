# Tentacular!

## Why?
### User Persona
Jack is new to learning code and is finding Github a bit overwhelming. He really enjoys finding inspiration in other people's repositories and always picks the ones with the most stars. He spends hours looking through different pages but wishes he could simply input his desired language and topic of interest and be served a list of top repos all in one place and without the hassle of Github.

### User Journey
Using our app Jack can simply got to our website and search for what he's interested in and any of the most popular languages provided in our list, then et voila! All the top starred repos are right there ready for jack to browse. :sunglasses:

## What?
What we've made is a website using a backend API call to github which can provide desired output to the browser.

## How?
The way we did this was:
- [x] Create a structure of files and overall architecture of the app
- [x] Upload all relevant npm modules and create the skeleton of the code with comments on each file to state what needed to be done
- [x] Make server.js and router.js following standard layout
- [ ] Use TDD to make handler.js :flushed: (we dealt with out API request in this file)\
- [x] In parallel to this we had created dom.js file to render the API call on the page
- [ ] Style the page using a mobile first process
- [ ] Ensure the page is accessible and intuitive

## What did we learn?
